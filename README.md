# SegTest

   I have done two task of medium & hard category of this project.
   
   
# Medium
    
    
    
  - Though in my fedora system it was tough to install SegannDB,Strangely I was unable to pull docker image or follow that guidlines to install it, instead I used VM image to do so.
  
   - I wonder if the tests results meant to be failed, cause it requires google authentication for testing, which I suppose was provided through testing profile archive & it didn't provide while I was running, so only Ist test pass.
   
   - I have uploaded the video for the same in this repo.
   
   
 # Hard
      
   - Here I created a new repo of the same code, well I think the forked repo may interfare the orignal one anyway.
    -So I am providing the link below, I have integrated the codecov coverage & travicCI integration to run the test. 
    
   - couldn't provide the webdriver to ci machine so the tests failed after build. It integrates the report of the test with each commit through codcov bot, hope you were asking for the similar in the problem.
   
   - About the java & c integration, codcov simply run them through bash script, I used bash for python in the repo,there is no
   C or java file to test on, but it just require two more bash command to imply that
   -  https://github.com/ajit2704/soc/pull/5
   This is directly the link of the pr, here you can find the coverage & the link below it the coverage report.
   Also ci integration where the build is performed.
